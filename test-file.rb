# Welcome to the git pull activity! This file contains a bunch of
# steps to demonstrate the process of working together on a piece
# of code via git. In the interest of time we'll be uncommenting
# code rather than writing it, but the same principals will apply.

# Task 1: One partner should uncomment this method, commit the changes
# and push to GitHub. The other partner should pull the changes down.
def duck_noise
  puts "quack"
end

# Task 2: Same as task one, but switch roles
def truck_noise
  puts "honk"
end

# Task 3:
#   1. Partner 1: change this method to puts "tick", commit and push
#   2. Partner 2: *before pulling*, change this method to "tock" and commit. Don't push yet.
#   3. Partner 2: now run git pull.
def clock_noise
  puts "tock"
